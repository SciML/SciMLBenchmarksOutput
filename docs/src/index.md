## Current Summary

The following is a quick summary of the benchmarks. These paint broad strokes
over the set of tested equations and some specific examples may differ.

### Non-Stiff ODEs

- OrdinaryDiffEq.jl's methods are the most efficient by a good amount
- The `Vern` methods tend to do the best in every benchmark of this category
- At lower tolerances, `Tsit5` does well consistently.
- ARKODE and Hairer's `dopri5`/`dop853` perform very similarly, but are both
  far less efficient than the `Vern` methods.
- The multistep methods, `CVODE_Adams` and `lsoda`, tend to not do very well.
- The ODEInterface multistep method `ddeabm` does not do as well as the other
  multistep methods.
- ODE.jl's methods are not able to consistently solve the problems.
- Fixed time step methods are less efficient than the adaptive methods.

### Stiff ODEs

- In this category, the best methods are much more problem dependent.
- For smaller problems:
  - `Rosenbrock23`, `lsoda`, and `TRBDF2` tend to be the most efficient at high  
    tolerances.
  - `Rodas4` and `Rodas5` tend to be the most efficient at low tolerances.
- For larger problems (Filament PDE):
  - `QNDF` and `FBDF` does the best at all normal tolerances.
  - The ESDIRK methods like `TRBDF2` and `KenCarp4` can come close.
- `radau` is always the most efficient when tolerances go to the low extreme
  (`1e-13`)
- Fixed time step methods tend to diverge on every tested problem because the
  high stiffness results in divergence of the Newton solvers.
- ARKODE is very inconsistent and requires a lot of tweaking in order to not
  diverge on many of the tested problems. When it doesn't diverge, the similar
  algorithms in OrdinaryDiffEq.jl (`KenCarp4`) are much more efficient in most
  cases.
- ODE.jl and GeometricIntegrators.jl fail to converge on any of the tested
  problems.

### Dynamical ODEs

- Higher order (generally order >=6) symplectic integrators are much more
  efficient than the lower order counterparts.
- For high accuracy, using a symplectic integrator is not preferred. Their extra
  cost is not necessary since the other integrators are able to not drift simply
  due to having low enough error.
- In this class, the `DPRKN` methods are by far the most efficient. The `Vern`
  methods do well for not being specific to the domain.

### Non-Stiff SDEs

- For simple 1-dimensional SDEs at low accuracy, the `EM` and `RKMil` methods
  can do well. Beyond that, they are simply outclassed.
- The `SRA` and `SRI` methods both are very similar within-class on the simple
  SDEs.
- `SRA3` is the most efficient when applicable and the tolerances are low.
- Generally, only low accuracy is necessary to get to sampling error of the mean.
- The adaptive method is very conservative with error estimates.

### Stiff SDEs

- The high order adaptive methods (`SRIW1`) generally do well on stiff problems.
- The "standard" low-order implicit methods, `ImplicitEM` and `ImplicitRK`, do
  not do well on all stiff problems. Some exceptions apply to well-behaved
  problems like the Stochastic Heat Equation.

### Non-Stiff DDEs

- The efficiency ranking tends to match the ODE Tests, but the cutoff from
  low to high tolerance is lower.
- `Tsit5` does well in a large class of problems here.
- The `Vern` methods do well in low tolerance cases.

### Stiff DDEs

- The Rosenbrock methods, specifically `Rodas5`, perform well.

### Parameter Estimation

- Broadly two different approaches have been used, Bayesian Inference and Optimisation
  algorithms.
- In general it seems that the optimisation algorithms perform more accurately but that can be
  attributed to the larger number of data points being used in the optimisation cases, Bayesian
  approach tends to be slower of the two and hence lesser data points are used, accuracy can
  increase if proper data is used.
- Within the different available optimisation algorithms, BBO from the BlackBoxOptim package and GN_CRS2_LM
  for the global case while LD_SLSQP,LN_BOBYQA and LN_NELDERMEAD for the local case from the NLopt package
  perform the best.
- Another algorithm being used is the [QuadDIRECT](https://github.com/timholy/QuadDIRECT.jl) algorithm, it gives very good results in the shorter problem case
  but doesn't do very well in the case of the longer problems.
- The choice of global versus local optimization make a huge difference in the timings. BBO tends to find
  the correct solution for a global optimization setup. For local optimization, most methods in NLopt,
  like :LN_BOBYQA, solve the problem very fast but require a good initial condition.
- The different backends options available for Bayesian method offer some tradeoffs beteween
  time, accuracy and control. It is observed that sufficiently high accuracy can be observed with
  any of the backends with the fine tuning of stepsize, constraints on the parameters, tightness of the
  priors and number of iterations being passed.

## Interactive Notebooks

To run the tutorials interactively via Jupyter notebooks and benchmark on your
own machine
1. Run Weave for the file (or folder) you are interested in
2. Activate the appropriate environment
3. Open and run the notebook.

Note: Since notebooks default to looking for a Project.toml file at the same level or parent folder, you might need to move the notebook to the folder with the appropriate Project.toml.

### Example (starting from the project root folder)
```julia
]activate .
]instantiate
using SciMLBenchmarks
SciMLBenchmarks.weave_file("benchmarks/Jumps", "Diffusion_CTRW.jmd", [:notebook])
]activate benchmarks/Jumps
```

Then move `Diffusion_CTRW.ipynb` to "benchmarks/Jumps" and open the notebook.

## Contributing

All of the files are generated from the Weave.jl files in the `benchmarks` folder. To run the generation process, do for example:

```julia
]activate SciMLBenchmarks # Get all of the packages
using SciMLBenchmarks
SciMLBenchmarks.weave_file("NonStiffODE","linear_wpd.jmd")
```

To generate all of the files in a folder, for example, run:

```julia
SciMLBenchmarks.weave_folder("NonStiffODE")
```

To generate all of the notebooks, do:

```julia
SciMLBenchmarks.weave_all()
```

Each of the benchmarks displays the computer characteristics at the bottom of
the benchmark. Since performance-necessary computations are normally performed on
compute clusters, the official benchmarks use a workstation with an
AMD EPYC 7502 32-Core Processor @ 2.50GHz to match the performance characteristics of
a standard node in a high performance computing (HPC) cluster or cloud computing
setup.
